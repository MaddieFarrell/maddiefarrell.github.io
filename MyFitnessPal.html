            <h2 class="heading">MyFitnessPal Redesign</h2>
            <p>This design project was created for my KPCB design application.</p>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>With today’s modern and hectic lifestyle, health and fitness often take a backseat to the rigors of everyday life. However, it is immediately evident from a simple browse online or glance at a supermarket bookshelf that diet and exercise remain to be something at the forefront of most people’s mind. The main problem being that most people just don’t know where to start. For me, the MyFitnessPal app has been instrumental in my ongoing health and fitness journey, helping me to simplify and plan a healthy lifestyle around my own everyday life, and avoiding the minefield of fad diets, and eating advice that I get barraged with on an everyday basis.</p>
            <p>With its huge community of more than 80 million users, exhaustive food database and easy-to-use tracking features, it's no surprise that it's one of the top-performing apps, not just in the health and fitness category. This is supplemented with various other functionality, such as a blog, tracking water intake, tracking your exercise, and weight tracking, but is not the central focus of the app.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
          <div>
            <p>User research is practiced to understand the user’s needs, behaviors, experience, and motivations through various qualitative and quantitative methods to inform the process of solving for users' problems. It is important to me that I go about user research with empathy in mind. Empathy means putting aside your own assumptions to see things from someone else’s perspective.</p>
              <h4>Research Goals</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Understand and identify usability issues in the MyFitnessPal iOS application through user research</li>
                <li>To understand more about the users.</li>
                <li>To learn more about one of the top health tracking applications.</li>
                <li>To create and validate potential design solutions</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>User interviews are a core user experience method. That's why I conducted user interviews with people who use MyFitnessPal regularly. I conducted these interviews so that I was able to undestand other peoples perspectives on the application as well as understand any frustrations and pain points that they have noticed. I was also able to gather insights related to users’ daily experiences with the app which helped me further gauge people’s experience with MyFitnessPal, while setting aside my own bias.</p>
              <h4>Customer Insights</h4>
              <p>After analyzing the interviews and the amount of data that was generated, below are the main pain points that were brought up to me abou the app during my user interviews:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The main functionality of the app is hidden away on a secondary screen</li>
                <li>The multi-add feature is often forgotten about by users</li>
                <li>Search functionality and scanning foods can often be quite cumbersome</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p>In addition, I researched the top compeitiors of MyFitnessPal. I wanted to be able to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these related applications in order to make more of an informed decision about my product strategy for my MyFitnessPal Redesign. Below is an aalysis of MyFitnessPal's top competitors.</p>
              <img class="picture" src="img/MFP/MFPCompA.png" alt="" style="width: 50%;">
              <h4>Market Insights</h4>
              <p>The main insights found is that because of the significant increase in the obese population, changing lifestyles, and increasing health concerns, these issues primarily drive the market growth. Other driving factors include increasing occurrence of diseases associated with obesity, increasing disposable income, and increasing awareness regarding health and nutrition. Some other market insights is: </p> 
              <ul>
                <li>The Global fitness app market size is anticipated to reach over USD 14.7 billion by 2026, according to a new study published by Polaris Market Research.</li>
                <li>Moreover, the growing penetration of smartphones is supporting growth. It is anticipated that by 2020, smartphone subscriptions would have reached 6.1 billion.</li>
                <li> In regards with the global fitness app market share, North America was in the forefront followed by Asia Pacific and Europe.</li>
                <li>In 2018, the highest demand was generated from apps related to fitness and wellness.</li>
              </ul>

          <div>
            <h4>Persona</h4>
            <p>Following user testing, and to help me further understand the users needs and behaviors, I then created a persona based on my key findings and takeaways from the users I spoke with.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/MFP/persona.jpg" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
            <h4>Key Pain Points</h4>
            <p> With my findings from my user research and my own assumptions, I was able to find some major and minor pain points, as well as being able to dig deeper and understand when they experienced them:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The main functionality of the app is hidden away on a secondary screen</li>
              <li>The multi-add feature is often forgotten about by users</li>
              <li>Search functionality and scanning foods can often be quite cumbersome</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2x2 Matrix</h4>
            <p> I then mapped these pain points on to a 2x2 matrix to better understand what points may be more important to both the business and the user.</p>

           <h2 class="heading">Design</h2>
             <h4> Design Proccess</h4>
             <ol>
               <li>The first step of the design process involved user interviews and desk research to understand how competitors and users behave. I believe it’s important to get this information early on in the process, before having an idea or prototyping.</li>
               <li>After analyzing these insights, I began to conceptualize the solution, focusing on user flows and wireframe to give me a way to iterate faster through ideas. From this, I went to the production mode, designing the interface considering design principles such as contrast, hierarchy and feedback, brand attributes, user interactions, and the imagistic universe presented as briefing by the case.</li>
               <li>Once the interface was ready, I took feedback from two other fellow designers in order to understand the experience gaps. Validation, although part of my usual design process, would be a post-conceptualization and interface step and won’t be discussed in depth in this case.</li>
             </ol>
           <h4>Ideate</h4>
            <p>Now that I identified the major pain points, I sketched several potential solutions and conducted comprehension tests with friends who fit the user testing demographic. I incorporated their feedback before creating my hi-fidelity mockups.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/MFP/SketchReasoning.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;">


            <h4>Prototype and Validate</h4>
             <p>After creating my sketches and testing their usability, I jumped into prototyping my final design solution.</p>
             <p class="lead">1. Home Page</p>
             <p>I came up with a new home screen layout aimed to arrange the key features that were highlighted by users. Beyond pulling the nutrition tracking tab out into the open as the main page, the home tab now provides the user with a full view of their daily caloric and macronutrient goals.</p>
             <p>I also proceeded to modify the app’s navigation bar, as the primary function of the home screen itself had now changed. The blog section then needed to be moved to a different tab as well. The current ‘Diary’ section of the navigation bar has also become irrelevant as its core features were now on the home screen, instead utilizing this space for the progress section.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/MFP/TrackComp.png" alt="" style="width: 70%">
             <p class="lead">2. Add Food Item</p>
             <p>During my user research, I noticed that the majority of users did not know about the multi-add feature that exists within the ‘Diary’ section, or they stated that they often forgot that the multi-add feautre was there, simply overlooking it.</p>
             <p>I believe this is mainly because the ‘Multi-Add’ button is located at the bottom of the food item's list. I wanted to optimize the user flow of adding food items by having the multi-add feature on by default. Finally, an ‘Add Item’ button was needed at the bottom of the screen to allow users to add either an individual item or multiple food items, by seeing the number of items that they will be adding.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/MFP/AddItemComp.png" alt="" style="width: 70%">
             <p class="lead">3. Navigation Add Button</p>
             <p>With the current app design, when you want to add a food item by pushing the add button on the navigation bar, users have to first choose add food and then decide for what meal. I eliminated that process by having the option to add food for a certain meal right at the beginning.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/MFP/AddButtomComp.png" alt="" style="width: 70%">
             <p class="lead">4.Progress Page</p>
             <p>I found that the majority of users never upload pictures onto the progress page when they are tracking their weight. So why not remove that feature and instead add the ability to view how their weight has been fluctuating since they started tracking. I also made the time frames of the progress graph to be out in the open, cause often users can forget that they can choose other timeframes via drop down on the current design. Also, instead of having a tiny add button on the top right corner, I made it easy for users to find where they can add their new weight.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/MFP/ProgressComp.png" alt="" style="width: 70%">
             <p class="lead">5. Blog Page</p>
             <p>Since the blog is no longer on the home page, and having an extra space in the navigation ar, I decided to move it into its own tab. Based on my user research, the blog is still relevant to users, and a majority of them like to go through the posts. So keeping the blog was important. Besides moving it to its own tab, I wanted to redesign it to be more pictures and fewer words. The large amount of words can demotivate users to continue swiping through.</p>

            <p style="color: black">Through user testing, I discovered that users often expressed confusion when searching for, and attempting to add food items to their diary. I also discovered that the primary function of the app was located on a secondary screen, over a blog page that the majority of users do not use as much. My design solution aims to reduce the number of steps needed for a user to accomplish their primary goal using MyFitnessPal, and to minimize confusion surrounding the main purpose of the app. This was done by redesigning the home page of the app, as well as the navigation bar, moving the blog to its own tab, and updating the progress page. All of this, while aiming to optimise the user flow around searching for and adding food items by making a number of smaller changes to the diary screen. Improving the user experience for these tasks would mean users are more easily able to update their nutriton, understand their success, and create and maintain healthier habits and lives. For MyFitnessPal, this would mean an increase in new user engagement and retention leading to a higher customer lifetime value.</p>
            <p class="lead" style="color: black;">What I Learned</p> 
            <p style="color: black;">This type of solo project provides UI/UX designers like me with an important opportunity to witness the challenges associated with redesigning projects, which are seldom as simple as they appear to be on the surface. As UX designers, we require the flexibility to tackle real user challenges while having to adhere to the boundaries set by a pre existing brand and UI. It’s these type of efforts that feed my passion in UX/UI and provide first-hand experience to improve the critical skills needed to take on ever more challenging problems.</p>
