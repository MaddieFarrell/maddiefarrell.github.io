          <div>
            <p>User research was conducted to better understand the users' needs, experience, and motivations involving their relationship and journey with fitness.</p>
            <br>
              <h4>Research Goals</h4>

              </ul>

              <h4>Methods</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Market Research</li>

              <br>
              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>Market research was completed to better understand the fitness industry and to help design the core marketing and brand strategies. The following are some of my market research results. <a style="color: #eb624f" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/269096/one-five-adults-health-apps-wearable-trackers.aspx">Source</a></p>
              <ul>
                <li> About one in three Americans report at some point having worn a fitness tracker such as a Fitbit or smartwatch or having tracked their health statistics on a phone or tablet app.</li>
                <li> High-income households, young adults and women among top users of fitness apps</li>
                <li> Revenues for health and fitness mobile apps are also thriving, reaching $510 million in 2015 and $2.1 billion in 2017. Polaris Market Research forecasts that the global health app market size will reach $14.7 billion by 2026. Other sources are slightly more conservative, putting the figure at $10.9 billion.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Market Opportunity (Why now?)</h4>
              <ul>

              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>User interviews were conducted in order to get better insights on the users' core problem. Here are some of the questions asked:</p>

                <li> What is your relationship with fitness?</li>
                <li> What is the hardest parts about working out?</li>

                <li> What don't you like about existing solutions you've tried?</li>
                <li> How do you discover and choose workouts to perform?</li>
                <li> What would you like to improve about your workouts?</li>
                <li> Have they ever used any other fitness apps? If yes, why and what do they like and dislike? If no, why not?</li>
              </ul>
              <br>

              <br>
              <br>
              <h4>Research Insights</h4>
              <p>After completing the user interviews, all of the information gathered was sorted by its commonalities. Here are some of the most common answers that were collected.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Over 85% of interviewees said the most difficult part of working out is due to the lack of motivation.</li>
                <li>Approximately 30% of interviewees don't know what workouts to perform to acheive their goals.</li>
                <li>Users generally want to be held accountable to complete their workouts.</li>
                <li>Approximately 50% percent of interviewees has tried using a fitness app.</li>
                <li>Users want to see data on progression in the form of strength gain or weight loss.</li>

              <br>
              <h4>Target Users</h4>

              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p> The goal of my competitive analysis was to be able to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of other related applications and how we will differentiate ourselves from them and gain advantage. The following is an analysis of some of Evolves competitors.</p>

             <br>
             <p class="lead">Questionaire Flow</p>
             <p>To provide the best experience and exercise plan for our users, the questionnaire flow collects information about our users. The information collected includes: name, age, weight, height, fitness experience, and fitness goals. This information is used to calculate the optimal combination of exercises, sets, reps, and weight.</p>

             <p>Evolve prepares new personalized workout routines each day for our users. Our algorithm uses our users past workout performance, recovery-period, and fitness goals to generate new workout routines with suggested progression and difficulty optimized to help our users achieve their fitness goals. As they continue to improve, we will adapt and increase the difficulty in their next workout.</p>

             <p class="lead">Bodyweight Tracker</p>
             <p> Based our user interviews, a high representation of our users' focus is weight loss. The bodyweight tracker helps our users track the metric that is most important to them.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_bodyweight.png" alt="" style="width: 55%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Alternate Exercises</p>
             <p>We discovered that users wanted the ability to change an exercise during our user testing phase. The core reasons include: difficulty of exercise, available equipment, and preferences. The alternate exercise feature allows users to replace an existing exercise with a related one.</p>
