          <div>
            <p>User research was conducted to better understand the users' needs, experience, and motivations involving their relationship and journey with fitness.</p>

              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>Market research was completed to better understand the fitness industry and to help design the core marketing and brand strategies. The following are some of my market research results. <a style="color: #eb624f" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/269096/one-five-adults-health-apps-wearable-trackers.aspx">Source</a></p>
              <ul>
                <li> About one in three Americans report at some point having worn a fitness tracker such as a Fitbit or smartwatch or having tracked their health statistics on a phone or tablet app.</li>
                <li> High-income households, young adults and women among top users of fitness apps</li>
                <li> Revenues for health and fitness mobile apps are also thriving, reaching $510 million in 2015 and $2.1 billion in 2017. Polaris Market Research forecasts that the global health app market size will reach $14.7 billion by 2026. Other sources are slightly more conservative, putting the figure at $10.9 billion.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Market Opportunity (Why now?)</h4>
              <ul>

              <br>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>User interviews were conducted in order to get better insights on our users core problem. Each of the interviews took approximately 20 - 30 minutes, some of the questions that I wanted answered is:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> What are the hardest parts when starting your workout journey?</li>
                <li> How do users find the right workouts?</li>

                <li> Have they ever used any other fitness apps? If yes, why and what do they like and dislike? If no, why not?</li>
              </ul>
              <br>

              <br>
              <h4>Research Insights</h4>
              <p>After completing the user interviews, all of the information that I gathered was sorted by its commonalities. Here are some of the most common answers that were collected.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For most people, the most difficult part of getting a workout started is lack of motivation.</li>
                <li>They don't know what workouts they should do to meet their goals.</li>
                <li>Users want to be held accountable to complete their workouts.</li>
                <li>Around 50% percent of interviewees has tried out a fitness app, most of those users were women.</li>
                <li>Recording bodyweight and weights lifted, as well as seeing progression over time is important.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Target Users</h4>
              <p>As a part of the design process, the users' needs and insight were defined based on market research and user research. Here are the users that we are targeting:</p>
              <ul>

              <br>
              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p> The goal of my competitive analysis was to be able to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of other related applications and how we will differentiate ourselves from them and gain advantage. The following is an analysis of some of Evolves competitors.</p>

            <p>The main color is dark orange, the dark orange was chosen becuase we wanted to combine redâ€™s power and energy and the friendliness and fun of yellow. Orange also represents how we want Evolve to feel to users, motivated, positive, and enthusiastic.</p>

             <br>
             <p class="lead">Splash Screen</p>
             <p>A splash screen was added to create a short introduction to our app and sets the tone for the rest of the user experience and ensures each usersâ€™ early experience is a positive one.</p>

             <p class="lead">User Sign-Up Flow</p>
             <p>To sign up for Evolve, users will enter their phone number and create a password. When that step is complete, they will recieve a SMS verification code. A confirmation code was added so we can decrease the number of spammers and to protect our users personal information. After entering in the verification code, they will have successfuly signed up and will be led into onboarding.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_signup.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Onboarding</p>
             <p>Onboarding screens were added to introduce Evolve to our users. With several onboarding screens, our users can easily enter the app and begin their workouts with confidence and excitement.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_onboard.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Questionaire Screens</p>
             <p>In order to ensure that Evolve provides the best experience and exercise plan for our users, we need to learn some information about them. The information needed is our users: name, age, weight, height, their fitness experience, and fitness goals. We use this information to calculate the best exercise combinations, number of reps, and weight heaviness for them.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_questions.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Exercise Screen</p>
             <p>Evolve prepares new personalized workout routines each day for our users. Our algorithm uses our users past workout performance, recovery-period, and fitness goals to generate new workout routines with suggested progression and difficulty optimized to help our users achieve their fitness goals. As they continue to improve, we will adapt and increase the difficulty in their next workout.</p>

             <br>
             <p class="lead">Personalized Workout Screen</p>
             <p>This screen consists of the workout that was generated for the user to complete for the day. The workout routines are designed using proven training methods adopted by celebrity and professional athlete trainers and includes proven workout methods such as progressive overload, DUP, and high volume training. Evolve acts as a personal training coach by incorporating these methods and strategies alongside your personal performance and progression to determine your readiness to maximize total volume/intensity and employ progressive overload.</p>
             <br>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_workout.png" alt="" style="width: 25%">
             <p class="lead">Bodyweight Tracker</p>
             <p> Based our user interviews, besides wanting to gain muscle and combat health conditions, another main reason for working out is wantingg to lose weight. Therefore, a weightloss tracker was necessary. On the bodyweight tracker page, a graph was added so users can visualize their weightloss and it gives them the ability to view how their weight has been fluctuating since they started the program.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_bodyweight.png" alt="" style="width: 55%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Alternate Exercises</p>
             <p>When we had users test our app, there was one pain point that came up quite a few times. The pain point was wanting the ability to swap an exercise for a different one. For some users, a certrain exercise may be to hard for them to do or they may not feel comfortable with an exercise. Based on this feedback, I designed a feature that allows users to choose a related exercise to replace the one that they don't want to complete.</p>
             <br>
            <img class="picture" src="img/E_alt.png" alt="" style="width: 55%">
             <p class="lead">Workout History</p>
             <p>Evolve allows our users to check their workout history since beginning the program. They have the ability to click on any day to view their completed workouts and calories burned. A workout streak display was also added to keep our users motivated and excited to complete their workout. I found that streaks give people a sense of competition, confidence and gives them more reasons to workout the next day.</p>
             <br>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_history.png" alt="" style="width: 25%">
             <p class="lead">Calorie Tracker</p>
             <p>The calorie tracker allows users to view on average how much calories they burn during their workouts. They have the option to view just one workout session up to all of the workout sessions that they have completed with Evolve. Evolve uses our users information (weight, height, age, and gender), the workout they completed and amount they lifted to determine the expected amount of calories they will burn. </p>

            <p style="color: black">Currently, Evolve is in the user testing phase. We have about 20 users who are consistently using our app, so we have been able to consistently receive feedback and catch any errors before launching. We are working on adding a couple of features that are required to launch Evolve in Apple's app store. Some of the features we are working on are a "forgot password" flow and finishing up the website. We are continuously working on improving Evolve and I will keep this updated as we progress.</p>
