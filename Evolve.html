            <h4>Lose weight and get stronger with a fitness plan designed for you</h4>
            <p>Evolve is a fitness app that uses artificial intellegince to create workouts that are personalized for our users to ensure that they will meet their goals. Our artificial intelligence is based on thousands of workout programs designed by the world’s top celebrity and professional athlete trainers to optimize your workout routine based on your training goals, experience, and performance. To create users custom-fit workout, Evolve uses AU to understand our users strength-training ability studies their past workouts and adapts to their workout settings.</p>
            <h4>My Role:</h4>
            <p>Product Designer:</p>
            <p>I designed the branding and logo for Evolve and the mobile application. In addition to working on the designs and information architecture, I conducted user research to learn more about our target users.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
          <div>
            <p>I conducted user research to gain a better understanding of our user’s needs, behaviors, experience, and motivations involving their fitness journey.</p>
              <h4>Research Goals</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>To better understand our target users.</li>
                <li>To discover users' pain points and frustrations around their fitness journey.</li>
                <li>To learn more about their process with figuring out what workouts they should do to meet their goals</li>
                <li>To create, validate, and iterate on potential design solutions.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Methods</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Market Research</li>
                <li>Survey</li>
                <li>User Interviews</li>
              </ul>
              <!--<h4>Assumptions</h4>
              <p>These are my hypotheses and assumptions before the user research studies:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Most students are not aware of the benefits of having a college mentor.</li>
                <li>Students have a difficult time finding a mentor.</li>
                <li>There exists no platform for college mentors and mentees to connect.</li>
                <li>Students want to connect with mentors who share similar interests and goals.</li>
              </ol>-->
              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>I have conducted some market research so that I can learn advanced information about the fitness industry. Market research is also helpful with forming our marketing, sales and brand strategy. It also makes sure that our product speaks directly to what the market wants, needs, or doesn’t yet know it wants and needs. The following are some of my market research results.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>About one in three Americans report at some point having worn a fitness tracker such as a Fitbit or smartwatch or having tracked their health statistics on a phone or tablet app.</li>
                <li>High-income households, young adults and women among top users of fitness apps</li>
                <li>Revenues for health and fitness mobile apps are also thriving, reaching $0.51 billion in 2015 and $2.1 billion in 2017. Polaris Market Research forecasts that the global health app market size will reach $14.7 billion by 2026. Other sources are slightly more conservative, putting the figure at $10.9 billion.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>I interviewed a series of people who have used other fitness apps, want to get into fitness but doesn't know where to begin, and users who are already into fitness.</p>
              <p>These were a few questions that I aimed to clarify through the user interviews:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>What are the hardest parts when starting your workout journey?</li>
                <li>How do users find the right workouts?</li>
                <li>What would they like to improve on pertaining to their workouts?</li>
                <li>Have they ever used any other fitness apps? If yes, why and what do they like and dislike? If no, why not?</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Research Conclusions</h4>
              <p>After completing all of the user interviews, I took all of the information that I gathered and sorted it by commonalities. Here are some of the most common answers that I have collected.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For most people, the most difficult part of getting a workout started is motivation. The most common phrase I heard was "I'm lazy"</li>
                <li>They don't know what workouts they should do to meet their goals, so they end up googling random workouts.</li>
                <li>Users want to be held accountable to complete their workouts.</li>
                <li>Around 50% percent of the people I intervied have tried out a fitness app, most of those users were women.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p>In addition to market research and user interviews, I researched companies that would be competitors to Evolve. I wanted to be able to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these related applications as well as how we will differentiate ourselves from them in order to make more of an informed decision about my product strategy. The following is an analysis of some of Evolves competitors.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Analyze</h2>
          <p>UMentor’s vision is to create a bridge between new and seasoned college students to connect and establish a strong mentor/mentee relationship. Here are some key features and components derived from the user research that should be included in the product:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Goals, interest, and preference settings to build a persona around the mentor/mentee profile.</li>
            <li>Mentor and mentee matching based on goals, preferences, and interests.</li>
            <li>Searching and filtering to discover potential mentor/mentee candidates.</li>
            <li>Mentor requests to allow mentees to reach out to mentors with a more distant background from their own.</li>
            <li>Messaging feature that allows mentors and mentees to communicate before officially meeting.</li>

          <div>
            <p>Branding is the way that we communicate with consumers, differentiate from our competitors, and create a name for ourselves in a world full of startups and great ideas.</p>
            <h4>Color</h4>
            <p>All of the colors that I have chosen are picked very carefully and with purpose.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/Evolve_color.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
            <p>I chose the main color to be a dark orange because orange is a combination of red’s power and energy and the friendliness and fun of yellow. Orange also represents motivation, positive attitude, and enthusiasm. When out users enter the app I want them to feel excited, motivated and ready to workout but I want to make sure they do not intimated though.</p>
            <h4>Logo</h4>
            <p>These are the two logos for Evolve. The first one is what users will so on the app as well as the website. The second one is our icon that will be seen in the app store and also in our application.</p>

             <p>After creating my sketches and testing their usability, I jumped into prototyping my final design solution.</p>
             <p class="lead">Splash Screen</p>
             <p>Splash screens are very important for mobile UX design. It is a short introductory screen that sets the tone for the rest of the user experience and ensures each users’ early experience is a positive one.</p>

             <p>The first step a new user has to undergo is signing up. When signing up, users will enter their phone number and password. After that is complete, they will get a SMS verification code sent to them. A confirmation code was added so we can decrease the number of spammers and to also protect our users information. After entering in the verification code, they will have successfuly signed up and will be led to the questionaire.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_signup.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <p class="lead">Onboarding</p>
             <p>These screens are added to introduce Evolve to our users. With several onboarding screens, our users can easily enter the app and begin their workouts with confidence and excitement. </p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_onboard.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <p class="lead">Questionaire Screens</p>
             <p>In order to ensure that Evolve provides the best exercise plan for our users, we must learn some information about them before we start. This information includes: name, age, weight, height, their fitness experience, and fitness goals. We use this information to calculate the best exercise combinations, number of reps, and weight heaviness.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_questions.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <p class="lead">Home Screen</p>
             <p>On the homepage, we have made all the features of the app accessible, such as that day's workout, bodyweight tracking, calorie counter, workout history, and settings. Evolve prepares new personalized workout routines each day. Evolve’s algorithm uses our users past workout performance, recovery-period, and fitness goals to generate new workout routines with suggested progression and difficulty optimized to help our users achieve their fitness goals. As they continue to improve, we will adapt and increase the difficulty in their next workout.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_main.png" alt="" style="width: 25%">
             <p class="lead">Workout Screen</p>
             <p>This screen consists of the workout that was generated for the user to complete for the day. These workout routines are designed using proven training methods adopted by celebrity and professional athlete trainers. These include proven methods such as progressive overload, DUP, and high volume training. Evolve acts as a personal training coach by incorporating these methods and strategies alongside your personal performance and progression to determine your readiness to maximize total volume/intensity and employ progressive overload.</p>

             <p class="lead">Bodyweight Tracker</p>
             <p>Besides, becoming healthier or gaining muscle, losing weight is one of the main reasons why people begin a workout program. A feature that was brought up many times by interviees' was being able to track their weight loss progression. Below we have graph so users can visualize their weightloss and the ability to view how their weight has been fluctuating since they started tracking</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_bodyweight.png" alt="" style="width: 55%">
             <p class="lead">Alternate Exercises</p>
             <p>When having users test out Evolve, one pain point came up quite a few times which is wanting to change an exercise. There is a couple reasons for this, such as the exercise is to hard for them, they are not able to do it due to injury, or they simply don't like that exercise. Based on this feedback, I designed an feature that allows users to choose a related exercise to replace the one that they don't want to do.</p>
             <br>
            <img class="picture" src="img/E_alt.png" alt="" style="width: 55%">
             <p class="lead">Workout History</p>
             <p>Evolve allows our users to check their entire workout history since downloading the app. They can click on any day to view completed workouts and calories burned.  Also, to motivate our users to continue working out, a workout streak display was added. Streaks give users a sense of competition, confidence and giving them more reasons to workout the next day.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_history.png" alt="" style="width: 25%">
             <p class="lead">Calorie Tracker</p>
             <p>The calorie tracker allows users to view on average how much calories they burn during their workouts. They have the option to view just one workout session up to all of the workout sessions that they have completed on Evolve. Evolve uses our users information (weight, height, age, and gender) along with their workout and amount they are lifting to determine the expected amount of calories they will burn. </p>

We have about 20 users who are consistently using our app, so we have been able to consistently receive feedback and catch any errors before launching. We are working on adding a couple of features that are required to launch Evolve in Apple's app store. Some of the features we are working on are a "forgot password" flow and finishing up the website. We are continuously working on improving Evolve and I will keep this updated as we progress.</p>
