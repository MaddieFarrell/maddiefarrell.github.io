        <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
          <div>
            <p>User research was conducted to better understand the users' needs, experience, and motivations involving their relationship and journey with fitness.</p>
            <br>
              <h4>Research Goals</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>To better understand our target users.</li>
                <li>To discover users' pain points and frustrations around their fitness journey.</li>
                <li>To learn more about the users' process on workout discovery to obtain their goals.</li>
                <li>To create, test, validate, and iterate on the product.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Methods</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Market Research</li>
                <li>Surveys</li>
                <li>User Interviews</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>Market research was completed to better understand the fitness industry and to help design the core marketing and brand strategies, ensuring that the product speaks directly to what the market wants and needs. The following are some of my market research results.</p>
              <ul>
                <li> About one in three Americans report at some point having worn a fitness tracker such as a Fitbit or smartwatch or having tracked their health statistics on a phone or tablet app.</li>
                <li> High-income households, young adults and women among top users of fitness apps</li>
                <li> Revenues for health and fitness mobile apps are also thriving, reaching $0.51 billion in 2015 and $2.1 billion in 2017. Polaris Market Research forecasts that the global health app market size will reach $14.7 billion by 2026. Other sources are slightly more conservative, putting the figure at $10.9 billion.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Market Opportunity (Why now?)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>People are becoming more conscious about their health, lifestyle, and fitness.</li>
                <li> Mobile and internet usage is at its peak with the recent tech boom and covid-19.</li>
                <li> The fitness social media influencer market is growing at an alarming rate.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>I conducted user interviews in order to get more insights into a better understanding of the problem. The interviews took approximately 20 - 30 minutes and included topics to get to the core of what the users thoughts and problems are in the fitness industry. So I asked:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> What are the hardest parts when starting your workout journey?</li>
                <li> How do users find the right workouts?</li>
                <li> What would they like to improve on pertaining to their workouts?</li>
                <li> Have they ever used any other fitness apps? If yes, why and what do they like and dislike? If no, why not?</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <img class="picture" src="img/E_quote.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
              <br>
              <img class="picture" src="img/E_quote2.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
              <br>
              <br>
              <h4>Research Insights</h4>
              <p>After completing the user interviews, all of the information that I gathered was sorted by its commonalities. Here are some of the most common answers that were collected.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For most people, the most difficult part of getting a workout started is motivation. The most common phrase heard was "I'm lazy"</li>
                <li>They don't know what workouts they should do to meet their goals.</li>
                <li>Users want to be held accountable to complete their workouts.</li>
                <li>Around 50% percent of the people that were interviewed have tried out a fitness app, most of those users were women.</li>
                <li>Recording bodyweight and weights lifted, as well as seeing progression over time is important.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Target Users</h4>
              <p>As a part of the design process, the users' needs and insight were defined based on market research and user research. Here are the users that we are targeting:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> People getting into fitness who want to gain muscle or lose weight</li>
                <li> People who value personalization vs. standard plans</li>
                <li> Beginners who need the push to follow a routine</li>
                <li> People with time constraints and a budget</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p>In addition to market research and user interviews, research was done on companies that would be competitors to Evolve. The goal was to be able to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these related applications as well as how we will differentiate ourselves from them in order to make more of an informed decision about our product strategy. The following is an analysis of some of Evolves competitors.</p>

            <p>Branding is the way that we communicate with consumers, differentiate from our competitors, and create a name for ourselves in a world full of startups and great ideas.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Moodboard & Color</h4>
            <p>I created a mood board and possible color scheme combinations to help generate ideas for how I wanted the app to look and feel.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/E_moodboard.png" alt="" style="width: 40%;">
            <br>
            <p>All of the colors that were chosen have been picked out very carefully and with purpose.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/Evolve_color.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
            <p>The main color is dark orange, this is because orange is a combination of red’s power and energy and the friendliness and fun of yellow. Orange also represents motivation, positive attitude, and enthusiasm. When the users enter the app, we want them to feel excited, motivated and ready to workout.</p>

             <p class="lead">Splash Screen</p>
             <p>Splash screens are very important for mobile UX design. It is a short introductory screen that sets the tone for the rest of the user experience and ensures each users’ early experience is a positive one.</p>

             <p class="lead">User Sign-Up Flow</p>
             <p>The first step a new user has to undergo is signing up. When signing up, users will enter their phone number and password. After that is complete, they will get a SMS verification code sent to them. A confirmation code was added so we can decrease the number of spammers and to also protect our users personal information. After entering in the verification code, they will have successfuly signed up and will be led into onboarding.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_signup.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Onboarding</p>
             <p>These screens are added to introduce Evolve to our users. With several onboarding screens, our users can easily enter the app and begin their workouts with confidence and excitement. </p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_onboard.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Questionaire Screens</p>
             <p>In order to ensure that Evolve provides the best exercise plan for our users, we must learn some information about them before we start. This information includes: name, age, weight, height, their fitness experience, and fitness goals. We use this information to calculate the best exercise combinations, number of reps, and weight heaviness.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_questions.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Home Screen</p>
             <p>On the homepage, we have made all the features of the app accessible, such as that day's workout, bodyweight tracking, calorie counter, workout history, and settings. Evolve prepares new personalized workout routines each day for our users. Our algorithm uses our users past workout performance, recovery-period, and fitness goals to generate new workout routines with suggested progression and difficulty optimized to help our users achieve their fitness goals. As they continue to improve, we will adapt and increase the difficulty in their next workout.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_main.png" alt="" style="width: 25%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Workout Screen</p>
             <p>This screen consists of the workout that was generated for the user to complete for the day. These workout routines are designed using proven training methods adopted by celebrity and professional athlete trainers. These include proven methods such as progressive overload, DUP, and high volume training. Evolve acts as a personal training coach by incorporating these methods and strategies alongside your personal performance and progression to determine your readiness to maximize total volume/intensity and employ progressive overload.</p>
             <br>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_workout.png" alt="" style="width: 25%">
             <p class="lead">Bodyweight Tracker</p>
             <p> Based on the answers from the user interviews, the three main reasons for beginning a workout are: losing weight, combatting health conditions, and gaining muscle. Therefore, a feature that we made sure to add to Evolve was being able to let users track their weightloss progression. Below we have graph so users can visualize their weightloss and the ability to view how their weight has been fluctuating since they started the program.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_bodyweight.png" alt="" style="width: 55%">
             <br>
             <p class="lead">Alternate Exercises</p>
             <p>When having users test out Evolve, one pain point came up quite a few times. This pain point is wanting the ability to swap an exercise for a different one. There is a couple reasons for this, such as the exercise is to hard for them, they are not able to do it due to injury, or they simply don't like that exercise. Based on this feedback, I designed a feature that allows users to choose a related exercise to replace the one that they didn't want to do.</p>
             <br>
            <img class="picture" src="img/E_alt.png" alt="" style="width: 55%">
             <p class="lead">Workout History</p>
             <p>Evolve allows our users to check their entire workout history since beginning the program. They can click on any day to view completed workouts and calories burned. A workout streak display was also added to keep our users motivated and excited to do their workout. Streaks give users a sense of competition, confidence and giving them more reasons to workout the next day.</p>
             <br>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_history.png" alt="" style="width: 25%">
             <p class="lead">Calorie Tracker</p>
             <p>The calorie tracker allows users to view on average how much calories they burn during their workouts. They have the option to view just one workout session up to all of the workout sessions that they have completed on Evolve. Evolve uses our users information (weight, height, age, and gender) along with their workout and amount they are lifting to determine the expected amount of calories they will burn. </p>

            <p style="color: black">Currently, Evolve is in the user testing phase. We have about 20 users who are consistently using our app, so we have been able to consistently receive feedback and catch any errors before launching. We are working on adding a couple of features that are required to launch Evolve in Apple's app store. Some of the features we are working on are a "forgot password" flow and finishing up the website. We are continuously working on improving Evolve and I will keep this updated as we progress.</p>
