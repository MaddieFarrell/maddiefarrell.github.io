            <p>Evolve is a fitness app that uses artificial intellegince to create workouts that are personalized for our users to ensure that they will meet their goals.  To create users custom-fit workout, Evolve uses AU to understand our users strength-training ability studies their past workouts and adapts to their workout settings.</p>
            <h4>My Role:</h4>
            <p>Product Designer:</p>
            <p>I designed the branding and logo for Evolve and the mobile application. Besides working on the designs and information architecure, I also performed user research to understand more about our target users.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
          <div>
            <p>I conducted user research to gain a better understanding of our user’s needs, behaviors, experience, and motivations involving their fitness journey.</p>
              <h4>Research Goals</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>To better understand our target users.</li>
                <li>To discover users' pain points and frustrations around their fitness journey.</li>
                <li>To learn more about their process with figuring out what workouts they should do to meet their goals</li>
                <li>To create, validate, and iterate on potential design solutions.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Methods</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Market Research</li>
                <li>Survey</li>
                <li>User Interviews</li>
              </ul>
              <!--<h4>Assumptions</h4>
              <p>These are my hypotheses and assumptions before the user research studies:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Most students are not aware of the benefits of having a college mentor.</li>
                <li>Students have a difficult time finding a mentor.</li>
                <li>There exists no platform for college mentors and mentees to connect.</li>
                <li>Students want to connect with mentors who share similar interests and goals.</li>
              </ol>-->
              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>I did some market research so that I can unnderstand uncover the high-level information regarding the fitness industry. Market research is also helpful with forming our marketing, sales and brand strategy. It also makes sure that our product speaks directly to what the market wants, needs, or doesn’t yet know it wants and needs. Below is some of my market research results.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>About one in three Americansreport at some point having worn a fitness tracker such as a Fitbit or smartwatch or having tracked their health statistics on a phone or tablet app.</li>
                <li>High-income households, young adults and women among top users of fitness apps</li>
                <li>Revenues for health and fitness mobile apps are also thriving, reaching $0.51 billion in 2015 and $2.1 billion in 2017. Polaris Market Research forecasts that the global health app market size will reach $14.7 billion by 2026. Other sources are slightly more conservative, putting the figure at $10.9 billion.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>I interviewed a series of people who have used other fitness apps, want to get into fitness but doesn't know where to begin, and users who are already into fitness.</p>
              <p>These were a few questions that I aimed to clarify through the user interviews:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>What are the hardest parts when starting your workout journey?</li>
                <li>How do users find the right workouts?</li>
                <li>What would they like to improve on pertaining to their workouts?</li>
                <li>Have they ever used any other fitness apps? If yes, why and what do they like and dislike? If no, why not?</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Research Conclusions</h4>
              <p>After completing all of the user interviews, I took all of the information that I gathered and sorted it based on commonalities. Below are some of the most common answers that I gathered that also answered my questions that I wanted to clarify.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For most people, the hardest part of starting a workout is motivation. The most common phrase I heard was "I'm lazy"</li>
                <li>They don't know what workouts they should do to meet their goals, so they end up googling random workouts.</li>
                <li>Users want to be held accountable to complete their workouts.</li>
                <li>Around 50% percent of the people I intervied have tried out a fitness app, most of those users were women.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>

        <h2 class="heading">Analyze</h2>
          <p>UMentor’s vision is to create a bridge between new and seasoned college students to connect and establish a strong mentor/mentee relationship. Here are some key features and components derived from the user research that should be included in the product:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Goals, interest, and preference settings to build a persona around the mentor/mentee profile.</li>
            <li>Mentor and mentee matching based on goals, preferences, and interests.</li>
            <li>Searching and filtering to discover potential mentor/mentee candidates.</li>
            <li>Mentor requests to allow mentees to reach out to mentors with a more distant background from their own.</li>
            <li>Messaging feature that allows mentors and mentees to communicate before officially meeting.</li>

            <p>Branding is the way that we communicate with consumers, differentiate from our competitors, and create a name for ourselves in a world full of startups and great ideas.</p>
            <h4>Color</h4>
            <p>All of the colors that I have chosen are picked very carefully and with purpose.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/Evolve_color.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
            <p>I chose the main color to be a dark orange because orange is a combination of red’s power and energy and the friendliness and fun of yellow. Orange also represents motivation, positive attitude, and enthusiasm. When out users enter the app I want them to feel excited, motivated and ready to workout but I want to make sure they do not intimated though.</p>
            <h4>Logo</h4>
            <p>These are the two logos for Evolve. The first one is what users will so on the app as well as the website. The second one is our icon that will be seen in the app store and also in our application.</p>

             <p>After creating my sketches and testing their usability, I jumped into prototyping my final design solution.</p>
             <p class="lead">Splash Screen</p>
             <p>Splash screens are very important for mobile UX design. It is a short introductory screen that sets the tone for the rest of the user experience and ensures each users’ early experience is a positive one.</p>

             <p class="lead">User Sign-Up Flow</p>
             <p>The first step a new user has to undergo is signing up. When signing up, users will enter their phone number and password. After that is complete they will get a sms verifcation code sent to them. I added a confirmation code so we can decrease the amount of spammers and to also protect our users information. After entering in the verification code, they will have successfuly signed up and will be navigated to the questionaire.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_signup.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <p class="lead">Onboarding</p>
             <p>These screens are added to introduce our users to Evolve. Having a few onboarding screens eases our users into the app and informs them about how Evolve will help them. </p>

             <p class="lead">Questionaire Screens</p>
             <p>To make sure that Evolve provides the best workout program for our users, we have to know some information about them before they begin. This information includes: name, age, weight, height, their fitness experience, and their fitness goals. We use this information to caluclate the most optimum sets, reps, and weight.</p>
             <img class="picture" src="img/E_questions.png" alt="" style="width: 85%">
             <p class="lead">Home Screen</p>
             <p>On the home page, we have made all the features of our app accessible, such as, that days workout, bodyweight tracking, calorie counter, workout history, and the settigs. Users will have the option to change weather they are working out at a gym or at home and the length of the workout they want to do.</p>

             <p class="lead">Bodyweight Tracker</p>
             <p>Besides, becoming healthier or gaining muscle, losing weight is one of the reasons why people start a workout program and diet.</p>

             <p class="lead">Alternate Exercises</p>
             <p>When having users test out Evolve, one pain point came up quite a few times which is wanting to change an exercise. There is a couple reasons for this such as the exercise is to hard for them, they are not able to do it due to injury, or they simply don't like that exercise. Based on this feedback,I designed an feature that allows users to chose a related exercise to replatce the one that they don't want to do.</p>

We have about 20 users who are consistently using our app so that we can recieve any feedback and catch any bugs before we launch.
