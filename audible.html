            <h2 class="heading">Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="lead">The Situation:</p>
            <p> Amazon Audible sells and produces audio books, magazines and podcasts and aims “to unleash spoken words that inspire, offer insight, teach, and persuade.” Audio content is produced through the Audiobook Creation Exchange, an online rights marketplace and production platform that connects narrators, producers and rights holders.</p>
            <p class="lead">Objective:</p>
            <p> I decided to take on the challenge of redesigning and improving the audible app based on user pain points and concerns about the app. I conducted face-to-face interviews to further determine and discover if a problem really existed in the Audible App. I wanted to hear real life experiences of people using the app and taking those experiences to redesign audible to become more user-friendly.</p>
            <p class="lead">Tools Used:</p>
            <p> inVision Studio, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop</p>

              <ol>
               <li><b>USER RESEARCH, EMPATHY, & UNDERSTANDING:</b> My process adapts to each project I work on; the core of my process remains consistent, and it always starts with research and understanding. It’s important to do this early on in the process, before having an idea or prototyping.</li>
               <br>
               <li><b>ANALYSIS & IDEATION:</b> The aim of the Analysis phase is to draw insights from data collected during the Research phase. Capturing, organising and making inferences from the “what” can help UX Designers begin to understand the “why.” Communicating the designer’s understanding back to end-users helps to confirm that any assumptions being made are valid. </li>
               <br>
               <li><b>DESIGN, TESTING & ITERATIONS:</b> The Design phase of a UX project is collaborative and iterative. Building on the user feedback loop established in previous phases, the premise of the Design phase is to put ideas in front of users, get their feedback, refine them, and repeat. </li>

              <h2 class="heading">Research</h2>
              <p>User research is the only way a UX designer can achieve an understanding of the people who are going to use their designs. If you don’t have a clear understanding of your users, you have no way of knowing whether your design will be relevant.</p>
              <p class="lead">Research Goals</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>To understand the user's pain points.</li>
                  <li>To understand the users needs and wants for the app.</li>
                  <li>To gain insights into their opinions of the Audible app as well and observe how they interact with the product.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="lead">User Interviews</p>
                 <p>In order to develop my understanding of user pains points on more of a deeper level, I conducted user interviews with current Audible users. I set up 1-on-1 interviews with many Audible users and asked them questions about their experiences with the app.</p>
                <p class="lead">User Pain Points:</p>
                  <p>After conducting my user interviews, I drew insights based off of the data that I had collected. These are</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>100% of the users that I had interviewed mentioned their frustrations with the fact that there is currently no way to purchase a book through the app, instead you have to go to Audible.com's website to purchase a book.</li>
                    <li>100% of my interviewees mentionted that they disliked the fact that there is no way for them to view their audible wishlist through on the app as well.</li>
                    <li>About 50% of my interviewees mentioned during the interview that Audible’s design is not very “warming” or “enticing”.</li>
                  </ul>

            <p class="lead">The Solution</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
               <p>Based on the answers that I got from all of my interview, here are some solutions that I came up with to create a better user experience for the users:</p>
               <p><strong>1. To add a feature where you can purchase the audible book from the app</strong></p>
               <p>One of the core gaols of this project is to modernize the product’s interface. Based on user feedback from user research, I decided that one featuring design change would be adding a purchase button. Currently, there is no way to purchase an audiobook from the app, so I added a button that allows users to purchase the audiobook and added a confirmation pop-up as well. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
           <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p><strong>2. Add a feature where you can view all of the audiobooks that are currently in your wishlist and also the ability to add books through the app.</strong></p>
            <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <p>To add onto the goal of modernizing Audible's interface and creating a better overall user experience for all users, I added a feature where the user can view all the books that they had added to their wishlist in app. There is currently no way to view your wishlist from inside the app, therefore, on the home page I added “Your Wishlist” section where you can swipe to the left to view all the audiobooks added. I also added a button that gives users the option to add a book to their wish list when they click on any audiobook as well.</p>
             <p style=" margin-top:50px "><strong>3. Designing the app to feel more pleasant and welcoming to the users.</strong></p>
             <p>One of the most common feedback that I received during my user research was that the app didn’t have a lively and engaging feel to it. To make the app feel more lively, modern, and engaging, I integrated more actions that a user can take. I added swiping gestures to ensure that Audible is more interactive and intriguing for the users. The swiping interactions were incorporated into most of the pages to allow users to swipe between books that they are currently listening too, suggested books, their wishlists, etc.</p>
             <p>To add the feeling of warmth and comfort, I added more of Audibles orange color and took away more of the grays that the app originally had. When you read a book you think of being cozy in a blanket next to the fireplace, sitting in your favorite reading spot, or laying on the beach reading your favorite book and that's how I want audible to feel to the users.</p>

            <p class="lead">Further Improvements</p>
            <div>
                <p>One further improvement that I would love to add to the Audible app would be being able to have bookmarks or timestamps where you left off before falling asleep. This would give the users the ability to easily find the spot where they stopped listening, so they don’t have to search the whole entire audiobook to find where they left off.</p>
                <p>I would also add metrics about each audiobook. Before users purchase a book, they could view metrics such as how far do people make it through the book, which chapters do they return to, and on average how long the book takes to complete relative to its run-time.</p>
            <p class="lead">Key Learnings</p>
            <p>Throughout this project, I came away with one major takeawayss that I hope will stay with me as I continue my journey as a UX/UI Designer:</p>
           <p>As UX designers, we require the flexibility to tackle real user challenges while having to adhere to the boundaries set by a pre existing brand and UI. Adding features seamlessly into the Audible app was a great practice in terms of the discipline it takes to consistently ensure that the new screens added adhere to the preset standards, while also ensuring that the screen or feature is the most usable it could possibly be for the user. That balance constantly challenged me to find an equilibrium between the company’s needs/desires and the user’s needs/desires and was really food for thought in terms of what is most important in that balance.</p>
