            <h2 class="heading">Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="lead">The Situation:</p>
            <p> When Spotify launched in 2006, it was clear that the music industry needed some help. Today streaming accounts for 75% of how we listen to music. By the time you’re reading this, Spotify will have roughly 198–210 million users worldwide. Currently, 83 million of them are paid subscribers with numbers expecting to reach 95–100 million by early 2019. With almost twice the number of subscribers than Apple Music, Spotify will remain to be the leader in the paid music streaming market. Spotify is dominating the music world, but how are consumers feeling about Spotify and how is it ultimately impacting music, and how we access it?</p>
            <p class="lead">Objective:</p>
            <p> Spotify is known to have one of the best UI and UX designs in the industry. Knowing this, I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can redesign part of Spotify in a way that is more interactive and lively.</p>
            <p class="lead">Tools Used:</p>
            <p> inVision Studio, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop</p>

                <ol>
               <li><b>USER RESEARCH, EMPATHY, & UNDERSTANDING:</b> User experience design begins with user research, to better understanding the needs of the people for whom the project is intended, and the context they will use it. I always start from studying the problem space, interviews with stakeholders and potential users, studying competitors.</li>
               <br>
               <li><b>ANALYSIS & IDEATION:</b> The aim of the Analysis phase is to draw insights from data collected during the Research phase. I went through the process of understanding our potential users, drafted storyboards, translate our goals into our tasks and tasks to the functions.</li>
               <br>
               <li><b>DESIGN & ITERATIONS:</b> The Design phase is collaborative and iterative. Building on the user feedback loop established in previous phases, the premise of the Design phase is to put ideas in front of users, get their feedback, refine them, and repeat. </li>
               <br>
               <li><b>USER TESTING:</b> After a solid prototype is built, I was able to test the product. I observed customer and product interactions, offered questionnaires and had interviews with customers to identify spots of difficulty or confusion. My main purpose of the testing was to eliminate problems, so I did this as early as possible. If I understand that I have to change something after user testing, I go back to the previous stages.</li>

              <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
                <p class="lead">User Interviews</p>
                 <p>I was able to interview several participants for my research. Interviewees were screened on the basis that they were regular users of Spotify. I spent a good portion of time with each participant, uncovering little bits of information from each real user about who they are and what their experiences are using Spotify.</p>
                <p class="lead">Key Insights</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>From my research, I was able to identify a common pain point amongst users. 75% of them said that the curated playlists that Spotify offers such as Discover Weekly were not really instrumental in addressing their needs to find new music. Spotify does intelligently predict what users would like to listen to however, it doesn’t allow discovery outside of their music taste.</li>
                  <li>Another pain point which I uncovered from my user research is that there isn't a good way to discover new music based on the genres that they liked and listen to the most.</li>
                  <li>A couple of my interviees mentioned that there wasn't enough interactions in the app and some aspects felt cluttered and unorganized.</li>

            <p class="lead">The Solution</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
               <p>Based on the answers that I got from my interviee's, here are some solutions that I came up with to create a better user experience:</p>
               <p><strong>1. Spotify Discover</strong></p>
               <p>I added a feature called Spotify Discover. This is where you can choose the genre that you want to listen too, then it gives you the most popular playlists, artists, and new releases that just came out.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Color Choices</strong></p>
              <p>I added additional colors to create a more exciting ambience while providing the original Spotify feel to it. The colors I added were dark purple and bright pink. The color purple has a variety of effects on the mind and body including: uplifting spirits, calming the mind and nerves, and encouraging imagination and creativity. Many people listen to music to be happy, relieve stress, or become energetic. Therefore, purple was an ideal color for my design.</p>
               <p><strong>3. Interactions</strong></p>
               <p>I added additional colors to create a more exciting ambience while providing the original Spotify feel to it. The colors I added were dark purple and bright pink. The color purple has various effects on the mind and body including: uplifting spirits, calming the mind and nerves, and encouraging imagination and creativity. Many people listen to music to be happy, relieve stress, or become energetic. Therefore, purple was an ideal color for my design.</p>
               <p><strong>4. Details</strong></p>
               <p>3. I also added a shadow to the bottom of the cell views. The provided the design with a 3D feel and makes the cell views pop out to the users. The shadow is a light pink shadow, so it goes along with the the color scheme of the design.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Results</h2>
            <p class="lead">Conclusion</p>
            <p>The know-it-all algorithms of deep machine learning that allows Spotify to curate custom playlists is enjoyed by many and is becoming the primary way of how we find new music to listen to. But it’s not an all in one solution, and should not be.</p>
            <p class="lead">Further Improvements</p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>In the ”Today’s Top Hits” page, I would add separators between each song to indicate the tap range of each song.</li>
                <li> On the genre page, I would implement paging with indicators, using UIPageViewController, to indicate how many genres are left to swipe through. </li>
                <li>On the genre page, I would add a search bar so users don’t have to continuously swipe to locate their genre.</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="lead">Problems That I Encountered</p>
              <p>One of the main problems, that I encountered, during this project was discovering a way to inform the users that they can swipe from playlist to playlist, song to song, or artist to artist.</p>
              <p>I developed many designs that informed users of the ability to swipe left or right. I implemented another design by adding a fade to demonstrate that there were more sections available. I also tried to integrate arrows. However, none of those solutions fit the design’s requirement. After a lot of research and trials, I discovered the concept of paging using a UIPageViewContoller. Paging with indicators solved the designs' problem of having an elegant way to display swiping capabilities.</p>
            <p class="lead"> What I Learned </p>
              <p>Since, a designer is involved in creating an app user experience, it simply does not mean to incorporate things as per his (her) will. A UX should be designed keeping yourself in user shoes. Understand their interests, and expectations from your app. Extracting your ego out as an experienced designer, and integrating their needs is what the right thing to do. Empathize with them to let your app connect with users on all levels.</p>
