            <h4>Blizzard Entertainment</h4>
            <p>Blizzard is a premier developer and publisher of entertainment software renowned for creating some of the industry's most critically acclaimed games. Blizzard Entertainment’s track record includes fourteen #1-selling games and multiple Game of the Year awards. The company's online-gaming service, Battle.net®, is one of the largest in the world, with millions of active players.</p>
            <h4>My Role & Responsibilities</h4>
            <p><b>UX Design Intern: </b><br>At Blizzard, I worked as a UX design intern on the Corporate Applications team. My main project was designing a conference room finder feature for the conference room displays. After I completed my project, I was able to propose and design features for the CRD(conference room display) that I believed would benefit the company. I took on the responsibility of creating user stories, mood boards, storyboards, design briefs, sketches, and mock-ups to help the team understand what to build and why. It was also important to me that I modify and enhance my designs based on stakeholder and user feedback, as well as technical input and business decisions. This is to ensure that the designs are consistent with the overall design vision. </p>
            <h4>Corporate Applications</h4>
            <p>The Corporate Applications team is responsible for creating innovative and transformative technologies to enable all of Blizzard to deliver and exceed on making epic experiences that engage and delight users.</p>

            <h4>My Design Process</h4>
              <img class="picture" src="img/blizzard_proccess.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
              <br>
              <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
              <p>When an employee wants to reserve a conference room but the conference room is booked, the only way they can reserve another conference room is by walking to another room or by booking from their computer.</p>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>The solution is to design a feature that will be added to the conference room display, which allows employees to find and book a conference room from any display. It will also allow employees to save time in finding and booking conference rooms, as well as finding meeting rooms that fit their specifications.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
          <div>
            <h4>What is a CRD?</h4>
            <p>CRD stands for conference room display. CRD's are located in front of all of the conference rooms. They allow employees to view the room's schedule along with the ability to reserve the room.</p>
              <h4>Assumptions</h4>
              <p>An assumption is formed out of the given problem and is assumed to be true. These are some of my assumptions that I made before user research:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Conference rooms often get double booked.</li>
                  <li>There is currently no other way to book a conference room besides walking up to that conference room display or by booking the meeting room on a computer.</li>
                  <li>Finding a conference room that fits an employees specification can be time consuming and stressful.</li>
                </ul>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>User interviews are a core user experience method. I was able to conduct user interviews with a number of Blizzard employees across the company with different years of experience and job titles. Through these user interviews, I was able to talk with them and learn about their experiences with booking and locating conference rooms and any other pain points that they have encountered.</p>
              <h4>Research Conclusions</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>There are a lot of times where a meeting room booked, but no one is in the room.</li>
                <li>The only way to view and locate other conference rooms is through the company directory.</li>
                <li>Navigating through other Blizzard buildings that you are not familiar with can be difficult.</li>
              </ul>

            <br>
            <p>Below is how I decided the navigation should look. I moved the "reserve" button more to the left and added a "find room" button to the right of it.</p>

            <p><b>Overview:</b> Below is the view when the user chooses to book a meeting room through a CRD that does not belong to the meeting room. The yellow bar at the top lets users know that they are on the CRD landing page of a different meeting room, not the one that they are standing in front of.</p>

            <p><b>Overview:</b> This is the end of the user flow. When the 2-minute time runs out, a modal will pop up asking the user if they need more time to reserve the room. This is to ensure that users who need more time won't lose any of their data and they can have more time to reserve. If there is no one on the CRD when the modal pops up, the screen will automatically switch back to the CRD landing page screen.</p>

          <div>
          <p><b>User Story:</b> As an employee, I want to be able to find other employees, so that I can find them to talk to them or if I need to ask them questions.</p>
          <p><b>Overview:</b> This feature allows users to find the desk location of other employees through the CRD</p>
          <p><b>Problem:</b> The only way to locate another employee's desk is by going to the Blizzards directory or by asking someone directly. Adding a person finder to the CRD will help employee productivity and save a lot of time and effort.</p>
          <p><b>Future additions:</b> One cool feature to add to the person finder is giving users the ability to ping another employee from a CRD. This lets the person who is being searched for know that someone is looking for them and which CRD they can be found at.</p>
          <p><b>Outcome:</b> Users will be able to find other employees through a list view. The page enables users to search and sort employees by title, email, department, and location. Once a user finds the employee they want to locate, they can choose to tap the locate button that brings them to a map that shows where that person's desk is.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Meeting room check-in</h2>
          <div>
          <p><b>User Story:</b> As a user, I want a check-in feature on the CRD, so that if a room is booked for the current time and no one is in the room or checked-in, the room can open up and lets other employees book the room.</p>
          <p><b>Overview:</b> Check-in removes ghost meetings.</p>
          <p><b>Problem:</b> While conducting user interviews earlier on in my internship, there was one pain point that was brought up more than once. The pain point is that employees often find themselves walking up to an empty conference room but the CRD shows that it is currently booked.</p>
          <p><b>Future additions:</b> One feature that I would add if I had more time would be a "book now" feature. This feature will allow users to quickly book a room in small intervals, starting from 15 min and up to 1 hour.</p>
          <p><b>Outcome:</b> Adding a check-in feature removes the possibility of ghost meetings. This means that if nobody shows up to the meeting after a set amount of time and doesn't check-in, then the room will unbook itself. When a room unbooks itself, a notification will be sent out to all employees who were supposed to be at that meeting.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Internship Reflection</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Since the end of my UX design internship at Blizzard Entertainment, I am able to reflect on my experience and learn from it. Here are some of my reflections:</p>
            <p><b>Be confident in your judgement</b></p>
           <ul><li>Early on, I realized that although it is important to take feedback into account for my designs, I should make sure that I exercise my own judgment as well.</li></ul>
           <p><b>Be proactive and take charge</b></p>
           <ul><li>During the internship, I learned how to be more proactive. This is because when I began my project, I was in charge of all of the user research, designs, and the features that I want added. Also, I was able to complete my project early, which game me the opportunity to pitch my ideas for the CRD and then take immediate action by designing it out.</li></ul>
           <p><b>Don't be afraid to speak up or ask questions</b></p>
           <ul><li>As an intern, it can be frightening to speak up in meetings. This is because you're in a new place with new people, most of whom are more senior. A lot of the hesitation around speaking up comes from the self-inflicted pressure to deliver smart and fully formed thoughts. Early on, I learned that the more you speak up, the more comfortable you will get. One thing that I was told by my mentor is that "there is no wrong answer and even the senior designers mess up all of the time".</li></ul>
