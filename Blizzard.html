            <h2 class="heading">Summer 2020 Internship</h2>
            <h4>Blizzard Entertainment</h4>
            <p>Blizzard is a premier developer and publisher of entertainment software renowned for creating some of the industry's most critically acclaimed games. Blizzard Entertainment’s track record includes fourteen #1-selling games and multiple Game of the Year awards. The company's online-gaming service, Battle.net®, is one of the largest in the world, with millions of active players.</p>
            <h4>My Role & Responsibilities</h4>

            <p><b>UX Design Intern: </b><br>Summer 2020, I had the incredible opportunity to work with the Corporate Applications team at Blizzard Entertainment to enhance the capabilities of their conference room displays. Throughout my internship, I worked closely with my manager, pm, and engineers to design my main project, which is a conference room finder/discovery feature.  I conducted user research and utilized design tools like Figma to create user flows and prototypes. Towards the end of my internship, I was able to research, pitch, and design my own ideas that will maximize conference room utilization and reduce room search time across employees.</p>
            <h4>Corporate Applications</h4>
            <p>The Corporate Applications team is responsible for creating innovative and transformative technologies to enable all of Blizzard to deliver and exceed on making epic experiences that engage and delight users.</p>

              <br>
              <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
              <p>The only way to to reserve another conference room is through a rooms own CRD or Blizzard's web application.</p>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>A room finder feature that will be added to the conference room display, which allows employees to find and book a conference room from any display. Allowing employees to save time in finding and booking conference rooms.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
          <div>
            <h4>What is a CRD?</h4>
            <p>CRD stands for conference room display. They are located in front of all of the conference rooms and allows employees to book and view the rooms schedule.</p>
              <h4>Assumptions</h4>
              <p>An assumption is formed out of the given problem and is assumed to be true. These are some of my assumptions that I made before user research:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The only way to book a conference room is through the CRD and web application.</li>
                  <li>Finding a conference room that fits an employees specification can be time consuming and stressful.</li>
                  <li>There are few accessible building maps on campus. </li>

                </ul>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>User interviews were conducted with Blizzard employees throughout the company with ranging levels of experience and job titles. I was able to learn about their experiences with booking and locating conference rooms and any other pain points related to the CRD.</p>
              <h4>Research Conclusions</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Meeting rooms are often booked while left unused.</li>
                <li>Besides walking around campus, the company directory is the only way to locate another conference room</li>
                <li>Navigating through unfamiliar Blizzard buildings can be difficult.</li>
              </ul>

            <br>
            <p>Below is the navigation that I came up with. I added a "find room" button to the right of the "reserve" button.</p>

This ensures that users who need more time won't lose any of their form data and they can have more time to reserve. After a short amount of inactivity, the screen will automatically switch back to the CRD landing page screen.</p>

          <p><b>User Story:</b> As an employee, I want to be able to find other employees, so that I can find them to talk to them or if I need to ask them questions.</p>
          <p><b>Overview:</b> This feature allows users to find the desk location of other employees through the company.</p>
          <p><b>Problem:</b> Word of mouth or the company directory is the only way to locate another employee's desk. Adding a person finder will increase employee productivity.</p>
          <p><b>Future additions:</b> One feature to add in the future is giving the users the ability to ping another employee from a CRD. This lets the pinged person know that someone is looking for them and which CRD they can be found at.</p>

          <p><b>Overview:</b> Check-in feature removes the possibility of booked meeting rooms left unused.</p>
          <p><b>Problem:</b> A pain point brought up more than once in user interviews is that employees often find themselves walking up to an unused conference room but the CRD claims it's booked.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Since the end of my UX design internship at Blizzard Entertainment, I am able to reflect on my experience and learn from it. Here are some of my reflections:</p>
            <p><b>Be confident in your judgement</b></p>
           <ul><li>Early on, I realized that although it is important to take feedback into account for my designs, I should make sure that I exercise my own judgment as well.</li></ul>
           <p><b>Be proactive and take charge</b></p>
           <ul><li>Throughout my intership, I learned how to be more proactive when it came to taking charge of the user research, user flows, designs, and any additional features.</li></ul>
           <p><b>Don't be afraid to speak up or ask questions</b></p>
           <ul><li>As an intern, it can be frightening to speak up in meetings. This is because you're in a new place with new people, most of whom are more senior. A lot of the hesitation around speaking up comes from the self-inflicted pressure to deliver smart and fully formed thoughts. Early on, I learned that the more you speak up, the more comfortable you will get. One thing that I was told by my mentor is that "there is no wrong answer and even the senior designers mess up all of the time".</li></ul>
