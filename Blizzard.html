            <h2 class="heading">Summer 2020 Internship</h2>
            <h4>Blizzard Entertainment</h4>
            <p>Blizzard is a premier developer and publisher of entertainment software renowned for creating some of the industry's most critically acclaimed games. Blizzard Entertainment’s track record includes fourteen #1-selling games and multiple Game of the Year awards. The company's online-gaming service, Battle.net®, is one of the largest in the world, with millions of active players.</p>
            <h4>My Role & Responsibilities</h4>

            <p><b>UX Design Intern: </b><br>For my UX design internship, I had the incredible opportunity to work with the Corporate Applications team at Blizzard to enhance the capabilities of their conference room displays and improve the effeciency around locating and booking rooms. I worked closely with the design manager, PM, and fellow engineers on the team to iterate and deliver a conference room finder/discovery interface. To enhance the displays and conference room booking process, I conducted user research with employees, utilized design tools such as Figma to create user flows and prototypes, and iterated through testing with users. After completing my summer project, I took it upon myself to research, pitch, and design a check-in/book now feature to maximize conference room utilization and reduce room search time across employees.</p>
            
            <h4>Corporate Applications</h4>
            <p>The Corporate Applications team is responsible for creating innovative and transformative technologies to enable all of Blizzard to deliver and exceed on making epic experiences that engage and delight users.</p>

              <br>
              <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
              <p>There exists no option for employees to find and book a conference through the conference room displays. Conference room discovery and booking is only supported via the internal web application, which is not always optimal.</p>
              <p>The only existing way to reserve a conference room is through the its display or the internal web application.</p>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>A new conference room discovery and booking feature, on the displays, allowing employees to quickly locate and book an available conference room to reduce the total time spent, across employees, searching for available rooms.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>What is a CRD?</h4>
            <p>CRDs (conference room displays) are iPads, located at each conference room, powering an internal application which allow employees to book cpnference rooms and view the room's schedule.</p>
              <h4>Assumptions</h4>
              <p>These are some assumptions that were made prior to user research:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The only way to book a conference room is through the CRD and web application.</li>
                  <li>Finding a conference room that meets a set of criteria is time consuming and difficult.</li>
                  <li>There are few accessible building maps on campus. </li>

                </ul>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>User interviews were conducted with employees across different levels of experience and roles to inquire about their workflow, experiences, and pain points with utilizing the conference room displays.</p>
              <h4>Research Conclusions</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Conference rooms are often booked while left unused.</li>
                <li>The internal web application is the only existing option to locate and book conference rooms.</li>
                <li>A significant amount of time is spent navigating through unfamiliar buildings while searching for conference rooms.</li>
              </ul>

          <div>
            <p>After finishing my UX design internship at Blizzard Entertainment, I actively reflected on my internship experience in attempt to learn and improve. Here are some of my learnings:</p>
            <p><b>Be confident in your own judgement</b></p>
           <ul><li>I realized early on that it is important to exercise my own judgement and communicate my opinions early in the process while taking feedback into account.</li></ul>
           <p><b>Be proactive</b></p>
           <ul><li>Being proactive allowed me to lead and conduct user research early, critique the team's user flows/designs, and design additional features outside of my project. It also provided me the opportunity to identify and improve other experiences and inefficiencies around booking conference rooms.</li></ul>
           <p><b>Don't be afraid to ask questions and voice your opinions</b></p>
           <ul><li>As an intern, it can be frightening to voice your opinions during meetings with your superiors. Most of the hesitation comes from the self-inflicted pressure to deliver intelligent and organized thoughts. However, my mentor had told me that "there is no wrong answer and it only gets easier with practice." Realizing that it only gets easier through practice and iterations has helped me break through this barrier early on.</li></ul>
