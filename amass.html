            <p class="lead">The Problem:</p>
            <p> The problem is not knowing the location and estimated time of arrival of the attendees of the event without having to constantly message them for updates.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Solution:</p>
            <p> The solution is an effortless and straightforward system that allows you to see the current location and estimated time of arrival of the attendees as a result of them instantly sharing their location as they sign up for the app.</p>
            <p class="lead">Tools Used:</p>
            <p> Sketch and inVision (Prototyping), Paper and Pencil (Wireframing)</p>

                <p class="lead">User Interviews</p>
                 <p>Before even diving into the features and the overall UX of my product I conducted some user interviews so I can gain a better understanding of the problem. These are some of the key takeaways from those interviews:</p>
                <p class="lead">Key Insights</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Locating all of the attendees before an event starts takes way to much time and can be exceedingly frustrating.</li>
                  <li>Organization is alway key to planning events. When planning an event, it is essential that you keep all of the information organized and clear.</li>
                  <li>Planning events with a large amount of attendees is both stressful and time consuming.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="lead">Key Experience Principles</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><b>Process:</b> The process of having to message all of the attendees just to be able to see how close they are is stressful and takes too much time. Being able to see someones location and estimated time of arrival just by a touch of a finger is less time consuming and takes away the pain of having to get in touch with everyone.</li>
                  <li><b>Location:</b> Being able to have your friends immediately share their location as they sign up for the app allows you to locate them when you want to know how close they are to the event.</li>
                  <li><b>Accuracy:</b> Being able to have everyone share their location, not only helps you to see how far away the attendees but allows you to get their accurate estimated time of arrival.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Meredeth is a 21 year old college student who lives in an apartment with two of her close friends. She is an extrovert who loves to talk and enjoys having people around her. Meredeth is constantly hanging out with her roomates and her friends. She is with her friends to either study, grab some food or to meet up for the night. Sometimes it is hard for her to invite all of her friends at once and trying to get them to the same place. She also wants to be able to know who is all coming and when time comes how close her friends are to the event that was planned.</p>

               <p>Keeping Meredith in mind, I mapped her user behavioral flow from planning and organizing an event to locating all of the attendees.

            <p>By analyzing Meredith's event planning experience I was then able to narrow down the features via card sorting for the necessary features for Event Meetup to function. I then created a content taxonomy map, to give meaning to the defined features, and a sitemap to organize the pages, information, and navigation of the app.</p>

                <p><b>Next Steps:</b> The next step is to design and build the alert popup that people who were invited will get to see. Besides building a popup alert, I will go through user tests again with screens relevant to people who were invited to the event to work out the kinks of the entire process and iterate again. </p>
                <p>Since this was a personal project, I had learned to set deadlines for myself and to stick with those deadlines otherwise there could be possible procrastination and it would take me awhile to finish. I also learned to stay organized and to keep everything together, this is so that all of my work is not scattered around my computer; therefore, I wouldn't have to spend unnecessary time looking for different parts of my project.</p>
