            <p>This is a design challenge created for my Google UX design intern application.</p>
            <h4>Brief</h4>
            <p>Your school wants to strengthen the community by encouraging experienced students to connect with new students and help them adjust to campus life. Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how someone may become a mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees.</p>
            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>Students who make meaningful connections with their peers and professors are more likely to thrive, both academically and professionally. Having a mentor is a vital part of the college experience, similar to attending lectures and study sessions. A good mentor can help you set and achieve your goals, provide you with advice and guidance, and support you through the hardships of college. Mentors and mentees need a simple and transparent way to discover one another on campus.</p>
            <h4>Solution Overview</h4>
            <p>UMentor is a mentorship discovery platform for new and experienced college students to find and connect with one another. Student mentors can provide new students with the knowledge, advice, support, and resources required to be successful early on in their college endeavors.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
          <div>
            <p>User research was conducted to acquire a more solidified understanding of the user’s needs, behaviors, experience, and motivations.</p>
              <h4>Research Goals</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>To better understand the wants and needs of student mentors and mentees.</li>
                <li>To discover students’ pain points and frustrations around finding mentors and mentees.</li>
                <li>To learn about the process of becoming a mentor and mentee.</li>
                <li>To create, validate, and iterate on potential design solutions.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Assumptions</h4>
              <p>These are my hypotheses and assumptions before the user research studies:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Most students are not aware of the benefits of having a college mentor.</li>
                <li>Students have a difficult time finding a mentor.</li>
                <li>There exists no platform for college mentors and mentees to connect.</li>
                <li>Students want to connect with mentors who share similar interests and goals.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Statistics</h4>
              <p>I wanted to develop a stronger understanding on the reasons why students are searching for mentors and the impact mentorship has on them. The following statistics confirmed some of my initial hypotheses and assumptions and demonstrated the need for a product that assists in connecting mentors and mentees in a simple and transparent manner.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>1 in 3 people grow up without a mentor.</li>
                <li>90% of students who have had a mentor are interested in becoming one themselves.</li>
                <li>Students who meet regularly with their mentors are 52% less likely than their peers to skip a day of school and 37% less likely to skip a class.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>I interviewed a series of students across all grade levels, with and without mentorship experience, to understand their perspectives on and experiences with mentoring. Through these user interviews, I acquired insights on the students’ mentorship experience and the pain points associated with it.</p>
              <p>These were a few questions that I aimed to clarify through the user interviews:</p>
              <br>
              <p>For those with previous mentorship experience:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>What type of students look for mentorship?</li>
                <li>How do students find mentors or become mentors?</li>
                <li>What characteristics do mentees look for in a mentor?</li>
                <li>How do mentors select their mentee(s)? Do they have a choice?</li>
                <li>What was the composition of their mentorship program? What did they like or dislike about it?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>For those without previous mentorship experience:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Are they aware of any existing mentorship programs offered? Do they know how to find a mentor/mentee?</li>
                <li>Have they considered becoming a mentor or mentee?</li>
                <li>Do they think having a mentor/mentee is important or useful? Why or why not?</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Research Conclusions</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Over 75% of students believe that having a mentor would be beneficial.</li>
                <li>66% of students do not know how or where to find a mentor.</li>
                <li>70% of student mentors/mentees did not have the option to choose or communicate with their mentor/mentees before being matched.</li>
                <li>66% of the mentors that chose their mentees mentioned that selecting mentees is painful. They want to mentor students who are self-driven and can benefit from them.</li>
                <li>100% of students believe that it is important for their mentors/mentees to share similar interests and backgrounds.</li>
                <li>25% of the students who participated in a program had difficulties relating to their mentors.</li>
                <li>Only 33% of the students knew about their colleges mentorship program and only 50% of those students utilized the program.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Analysis</h4>
              <p>UMentor’s vision is to create a bridge between new and seasoned college students to connect and establish a strong mentor/mentee relationship. Here are some key features and components derived from the user research that should be included in the product:</p>
             <ol>
              <li>Goals, interest, and preference settings to build a persona around the mentor/mentee profile.</li>
              <li>Mentor and mentee matching based on goals, preferences, and interests.</li>
              <li>Searching and filtering to discover potential mentor/mentee candidates.</li>
              <li>Mentor requests to allow mentees to reach out to mentors with a more distant background from their own.</li>
              <li>Messaging feature that allows mentors and mentees to communicate before officially meeting.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Sketches</h4>
            <p>After developing a clear understanding of the users’ preferences and the features required to address and alleviate the users’ paint points, I was finally able to start sketching the main user interfaces of the product.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/Gsketch1.jpg" alt="" style="width: 40%;">
            <br>
            <img class="picture" src="img/Gsketch2.jpg" alt="" style="width: 40%;">
            <h4>Wireframes</h4>
            <p>After sketching and iterating the designs on paper, I started creating low-fidelity mockups of the product in Sketch app. The next couple slides will show the final results of the mockups.</p>
            <p class="lead">User Sign Up Flow</p>
            <p>The first step a new user has to undergo is signing up. Upon completion of signing up, the user will be redirected to a screen to designate themselves as a mentor or mentee. After the role has been chosen, they will be sent to a screen to enter background information about themselves and their objectives. The form includes their: name, college, major, gender and what they are looking for in a mentor or mentee. The information gathered will be used in the matching algorithm and displayed on the profile screen.
            <br>The app contains four main functions, each represented by a tab on the tab bar. The main components are: discover, messages, requests, and profile. The next couple of slides with go more into detail about these features.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/mentorHome.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
            <p class="lead"> Discover</p>
            <p>UMentor’s purpose is to establish a strong and meaningful mentor/mentee connection. Offering a seamless process for students to discover other students with similar goals, passions, and background is critical to achieving the goal. On the discovery page, users see a list of suggested mentors or mentees. These mentors/mentees match the users’ preferences and share similar interests. A search and filter option was also implemented for the users to discover based on major, grade level, gender, etc.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/mentorDiscover.png" alt="" style="width: 20%;">
            <p class="lead"> Messages</p>
            <p>Providing users with the ability to chat with their mentors or mentees before meeting is a crucial component to the product. This discovery was derived from the fact that the majority of the interviewees, from the user research, are skeptical with selecting a mentor/mentee before establishing a connection with them. The messaging component allow the users to chat with their mentors/mentees and develop a stronger relation before making a decision.</p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/mentorMessages.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
            <p class="lead">Requests</p>
            <p>The requests feature provides mentees with the ability to connect with mentors, that were not previously recommended, after discovering them through the search feature. Students should have the option to reach out to mentors with a more distant background from their own, which provides mentees access to mentorship in a diverse set of fields that differ from their core studies. For example, a engineering student might be interested in reaching out to a mentor who specializes in business or design to increase their skill set and grow in that field. </p>
            <img class="picture" src="img/mentorRequests.png" alt="" style="width: 20%;">
            <p class="lead">Profile</p>
            <p>The profile screen is another critical component of UMentor. According to most of the interviewed students, it is important for them to be able to find a mentor/mentee that align with their ambitions and interests. The profile screen allows them to learn more about potential mentors/mentees and provides the necessary information to make an informed decision on which mentors/mentees to request. Mentors will also be able to see the students that they are currently mentoring and mentees will be able to see their mentors.</p>

            <p style="color: black">During the final iterations of UMentor, I started to see this potentially becoming a real product. However, there is always room to make further improvements to all products. If I had more time to work on UMentor, I would love to continue adding additional features and improvements. </p>
            <h4 style="color: black;" >If I had more time</h4>
            <br>
            <p style="color: black;" class="lead">Google Platform Integrations</p>
            <p style="color: black;" >There are several Google platform/product integrations that could drastically improve the user experience of UMentor. Below are some examples that UMentor could benefit from:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Calendar: syncing with Google Calendar improves the experience around scheduling meetups and chats between mentors and mentees.</li>
              <li>Google Duo/Hangouts Integration: creates the ability to video chat and meet virtually with mentors.</li>
              <li>Google Jamboard: integrating with Jamboard will make virtual meetings between mentees and mentors much more effective.</li>
              <li>Google Drive: integrating Google Drive to UMentor can help mentees and mentors embed and share documents, files, and photos with each other within the app.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color: black;" class="lead">Groups</p>
            <p style="color: black;" >Groups is another feature that UMentor could benefit from in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Since mentorship between a mentor and mentee is often a one-to-one relationship, many lack the feeling of having a strong community around them.</li>
              <li>If a mentor is mentoring multiple students on the same topic, the mentor can now create a group dashboard.</li>
              <li>Having groups can provide mentees the opportunity to meet peers with similar interests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color: black;" class="lead">Rate My Mentor</p>
            <p style="color: black;">Support for writing reviews and feedback for mentors could improve the discovery process for future mentees. Mentees now have the ability to see other mentees’ experiences with and opinions of the mentors. Mentors will receive constructive criticism on how they can improve and grow as a mentor.</p>
