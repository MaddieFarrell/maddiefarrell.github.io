            <p class="lead">My Role:</p>
            <p>Product Design Intern</p>

            <div>
                <p>User interviews are a core user experience method. That's why I conducted user interviews on small and medium sized businesses too see how they acquire most of their customers and to talk to them about their thoughts on referrals and referral systems. To talk to these business owners,I walked into small businesses to talk to either the manager or owner.</p>
                <p class="lead">Customer Insights</p>
                <p>After analysing the interviews, despite the amount of generated data, this was the most relevant information for decision-making in creating the solution:</p>
                <p>90% Believe that customer referrals is the largest ways that they acquire new customers.</p>
                <p>100% Would use a referral system, if they don't have to manage and organize it themselves.</p>
                <p class="lead">Desk Research</p>
                <p>In addition, I researched data and habits related to other current loyalty and referral programs. The goal was to understand how competitors behave and benchmark innovative reward programs.</p>
                <p class="lead">Market Insights</p>
                <p>The main insights found is that Loyalty programs have been proven as one of the most effective tactics for increasing revenue and inspiring customer loyalty. 77% of people are more likely to purchase if they’re referred to a product by their family and friends. 83% of satisfied customers are willing to refer your business but only 29% actually do if there are no incentives to do so.</p>

             <p class="lead"> Design Proccess</p>
             <ol>
               <li>The first step of the design process involved user interviews and desk research to understand how competitors and users behave. I believe it’s important to get this information early on in the process, before having an idea or prototyping.</li>
               <li>After analysing this insights, I began to conceptualize the solution, focusing on user flows and wireframe to give me a way to iterate faster through ideas. From this, From this, I went to the production mode, designing the interface considering design principles such as contrast, hierarchy and feedback; brand attributes; user interactions, and the imagistic universe presented as briefing by the case.</li>
               <li>Once the interface was ready, I took feedback from two other fellow designers in order to understand the experience gaps. Validation, although part of my usual design process, would be a post-conceptualization and interface step and won’t be discussed in depth in this case.</li>

            <p>For the logo, I wanted the feel of it to be simple and clean but also have meaning to the company. The companies name Lorro is based of the word parrot in spanish, which is loro. We decided to go with lorro because the company is about creating more customers for businesses through the word of mouth and relaying messages, which is what a parrot is very good at doing. Therefore, I incorporated a parrot into our logo.</p>
