            <p class="lead "> Lorro offers a professional referral program that will help grow local businesses through their customers network.</p>
            <p>Lorro's program, for small and medium businesses, will drive more valuable customer acquisitions. We incentivize customers with rewards for making these referrals, and points can be redeemed for everything from product discounts to free services. This will eliminate the need for small businesses to go through with superfluous sales and marketing tactics which will save them money on advertising.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Product Design Intern:</p>
            <p>As a product design intern, I designed the brand identity, iPad application, logo, and the website for Lorro. I also conducted user research to understand more about how SMB's acquire their customers, so that Lorro can build a better product for these businesses.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">User Research</h2>
          <div>
            <h4> Pre-Pilot User Research</h4>
            <p>User research is practiced to understand the user’s needs, behaviors, experience, and motivations through various qualitative and quantitative methods to inform the process of solving for users' problems. It is important to me that I go about user research with empathy in mind. Empathy means putting aside your own assumptions to see things from someone else’s perspective.</p>
              <p class="lead">Research Goals</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Define business owner's goals for their company.</li>
                <li>Determine where most of their customers come from.</li>
                <li>Understand their views on referral programs.</li>
                <li>Understand their frustrations involving referrals and obtaining new customers.</li>
                <li>Understand business owners needs when it comes to acquiring new customers and marketing.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="lead">User Interviews</p>
              <p>User interviews are a core user experience method. That's why I conducted user interviews on small and medium sized businesses to see how they acquire most of their customers and to talk to them about their thoughts on referrals and referral systems. To conduct these interviews, I walked into small businesses to talk to either the manager or owner.</p>
              <p class="lead">Customer Insights</p>
              <p>After analyzing the interviews and the amount of data that was generated, this was the most relevant information for decision-making for creating the solution:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>90% of small business owners believe that customer referrals are the largest ways that they acquire new customers.</li>
                <li>85% would use a referral system if they don't have to manage and organize it themselves.</li>
                <li>50% of small business owners already have some sort of referral program that they are not happy with.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="lead">Desk Research</p>
              <p>In addition, I researched data and habits related to other current loyalty and referral programs. The goal was to understand how competitors behave and benchmark innovative reward programs.</p>
              <p class="lead">Market Insights</p>
              <p>The main insights found are that loyalty programs have been proven as one of the most effective tactics for increasing revenue and inspiring customer loyalty:</p> 
              <ul>
                <li>77% of people are more likely to purchase if they’re referred to a product by their family and friends.</li>
                <li> 83% of satisfied customers would be willing to refer your business</li>
                <li>but only 29% actually do if there are no incentives to do so.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4> Post-Pilot User Research</h4>
              <p>After our product was in its first store, I continued on with my user research. </p>
              <p class="lead">Customer Observation</p>
                <p>For the first couple days, I sat in the salon and watched how customers interacted with our product. There are a couple things that I was looking for:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>How many customers interacted with the product.</li>
                  <li>How many customers signed up for the program.</li>
                  <li>How many customers went through the entire flow vs. stopped at a certain point.</li>
                  <li>Did customers have any confusion with singing up with for program?</li>
                  <li>Was there anything that I noticed that could be changed to be more usable for the customers?</li>
                </ol>
              <p class="lead">In-store Customer User Inverviews</p>
              <p>At the end of the first week that our product was piloted, I went into the store again and watched how customers interacted with our product. However, this time if I noticed that customers didn't sign up for the program, I went up to them and asked them nicely why they didn't sign up for the referral program. Here are the most common answers that I received:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>They are not from the Bay Area or they will be moving away soon</li>
                <li>They didn't know how long it would take to sign up for the program</li>
                <li>This was their first time to the salon and they were not sure if they were going to come back</li>
                <li>They generally tend not to refer their friends to businesses even if they like the place.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>To view more in depth, detailed user research and the rest of my data that was gathered, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZotRZH3qj0kPVeTS0Tu4TqDp1o2n1hPVYMTgRoAAnU/edit?usp=sharing" style="color: #72e4ad;"><b>click here</b></a></p>

            <img src="img/Moodboard.jpg" alt="" class="moodboard">
            <br>
            <p>Branding is the way that we communicate with consumers, differentiate from our competitors, and create a name for ourselves in a world full of startups and great ideas. A moodboard is a great way to visually research more about a brand or style. The colors that I want to use in my designs are based off the tropical rainforest. All of the colors that I have chosen are picked very carefully and with purpose.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>I chose two different green colors. One is bright and exciting, the other one gives more of a calming feel. Green has the meaning of growth, harmony, renewal, safety, and money what we want business owners to feel. The bright green that I chose was also based on the color of the green parrot.</li>
              <li>Blue is the color of trust and peace. It also suggests loyalty and integrity. We want our customers to trust our referrals program, and we want the business to gain more customer loyalty through our referral and loyalty program. Also, since the theme is based of parrots and the rain forest, I chose blue to give off the sense of peace and tranquility of the ocean.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            <h3>iPad App</h3>
             <p>The iPad application will be used at small and local businesses point of sale with their customers. New customers can claim their reward and join the referral's program by simply entering their phone number, and a referral code. Customers claim and apply rewards received from being referred or referring new customers.</p>
             <br>
             <p class="lead"> Design Proccess</p>
             <ol>
               <li>The first step of the design process involved user interviews and desk research to understand how competitors and users behave. I believe it’s important to get this information early on in the process, before having an idea or prototyping.</li>
               <li>After analyzing these insights, I began to conceptualize the solution, focusing on user flows and wireframe to give me a way to iterate faster through ideas. From this, I went to the production mode, designing the interface considering design principles such as contrast, hierarchy and feedback, brand attributes, user interactions, and the imagistic universe presented as briefing by the case.</li>
               <li>Once the interface was ready, I took feedback from two other fellow designers in order to understand the experience gaps. Validation, although part of my usual design process, would be a post-conceptualization and interface step and won’t be discussed in depth in this case.</li>

I wanted this page to give the customers the feeling of excitement, exuberance, and motivation. That is why I added the animation. There is about ten different illustrations that the customer could see when they view their reward. I wanted to ensure that they don't see the same illustration every time they get a reward. </p>
            <p>For this page, I went and conducted A/B testing. I talked to different users, one group was shown the screen with an illustration and information about their reward. The other group was shown the screen above with the animation. I wanted to ensure that the customers feel rewarded and happy when they receive their accolade.</p>

          <h3>Signage</h3>
          <p>Our product was first piloted at a hair salon. After the first week of piloting and watching customer interactions, I decided that we needed a better way to communicate in-store about the referral program. I came up with a small 7 x 7 inch poster that sits on the bottom corner of the stylist's mirror. So when a customer is getting their hair cut, they can at least see that there is a referral program and gives them the chance to ask their stylist for more information.</p>

          <h3>Logo</h3>
          <p>For the logo, I wanted the feel of it to be simple and clean, but also have meaning to the company. The companies name Lorro is derived from ‘loro’, the spanish word for parrot. We decided to go with Lorro because the company is about creating more customers for businesses through the word of mouth and relaying messages, which is what a parrot is very good at doing. Therefore, I incorporated a parrot into our logo.</p>

          <h3>Lorro's First Pilot</h3>
          <p> Our product was first piloted in a hair salon in the Bay Area. Being able to pilot our product was critical, as it provides us vital feedback about the feasibility of our product, market potential, as well as critical enhancements that will increase the product's chances of success. Having piloted, I was able to watch how customers and employees interacted with the product. Which allowed me to notice some pain points and design flaws which I wouldn't have noticed without the pilot. It is amazing as a designer to see users interact with the product that you put so much time researching and designing for. </p>
